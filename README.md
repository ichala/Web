# WebPhone

> WebPhone is an open-source web application that simulates a real smart phone. You will find apps, games, and features that behave and run as they were on mobile , but this time you won't need any hardware, money, or extra resources to own and run this virtual phone; all you need is a browser & an internet connection.
